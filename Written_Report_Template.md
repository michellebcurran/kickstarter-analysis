# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Purpose of this analysis is to produce two charts that outline the two following deliverables, the outcomes based on launch date, and outcomes based on goals. The outcomes based on launch date shows how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date. The outcomes based on goals shows how different campaigns fared in relation to their funding goals. The charts visualize campaign outcomes for launch dates and funding goals to better analyze the data.

## Analysis and Challenges

Analysis was derived from the following excel file:
![Kickstarter_Challenge](iCloud Drive/Desktop/Data Analytics Bootcamp/Module 1 Challenge/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlxs)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The following image is the chart produced based on the data manipulated for Outcomes Based on Launch Date sheet.

![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](iCloud Drive/Desktop/Data Analytics Bootcamp/Module 1 Challenge/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
---
The most successful outcomes peak in May, and none were canceled in October. 
---
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The following image is the chart produced based on the data manipulated for Outcomes Based on Goals sheet.
---
![Outcomes_vs_Goals](iCloud Drive/Desktop/Data Analytics Bootcamp/Module 1 Challenge/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
---
The highest successful outcomes based on goals are in the range less than 1000 to 4999. The most failed is around 45000 to 49999, and conversely the least successful is in this interval too. Therefore, overall, the lower the goal the higher the success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were no challenges or difficulties encountered in Deliverable 1.
For Deliverable 2, I had the challenge of making the "Sum of Percentage x" change to "Percentage x" in the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, as seen below.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Overall, there were more successful outcomes than failed, and very few canceled.
---
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Overall, the lower the goal the higher the success rate.
---
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Live is not considered in the percentage.
---
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Outcomes Based on Country.
Outcomes Based on Average Donation.
Outcomes Based on Duration.
